This is a common codebase for generating ROP-chains/etc for Wii U exploits. This uses addresses auto-located from coreinit. Currently only binary ROP-chains are supported.

You must specify the "sysver={val}" URL parameter for pages using this codebase, for selecting your Wii U system-version:
* "532": 5.3.2
* "550": 5.5.0
